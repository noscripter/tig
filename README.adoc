What is Tig?
------------
Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. It functions mainly
as a Git repository browser, but can also assist in staging changes for
commit at chunk level and act as a pager for output from various Git
commands.

Q&A / Notes
-----------

*Q: Zsh completion for `tig` does not list options/subcommands (Tab only completes files).*

Make sure the completion files are installed in your `fpath` and that Zsh has
rebuilt its completion cache:

	$ mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
	$ cp contrib/tig-completion.zsh ~/.zsh/completions/_tig
	$ cp contrib/tig-completion.bash ~/.zsh/completions/tig-completion.bash

Then add to `~/.zshrc` (recommended: keep both files in the same directory):

	fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
	autoload -Uz compinit && compinit

If your system already provides Tig's bash completion (often installed as `tig` in
the bash-completion completions directory), you can point the Zsh wrapper to it:

	zstyle ':completion:*:*:tig:*' script /path/to/tig

If you previously ran `compinit`, remove the cached dump and re-run it:

	$ rm -f ~/.zcompdump*
	$ compinit
